The crease is a surface operator folded by a finite angle along an infinite line. Several realisations 
of it in the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory are studied here. It plays a role similar to the generalised 
quark-antiquark potential, or the cusp anomalous dimension, in gauge theories. We identify a 
finite quantity that can be studied despite the conformal anomalies ubiquitous with surface 
operators and evaluate it in free field theory and in the holographic dual. We also find a subtle 
difference between the infinite crease and its conformal transform to a compact observable 
comprised of two glued hemispheres, 
reminiscent of the circular Wilson loop. We prove by a novel application of 
defect CFT techniques for the $SO(2,1)$ symmetry along the fold 
that the near-BPS behaviour of the 
crease is determined as the derivative of the compact observable with respect to its angle, 
as in the bremsstrahlung function. We also comment about the lightlike limit of the crease in 
Minkowski space.
