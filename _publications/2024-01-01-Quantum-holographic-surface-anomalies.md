Expectation values of surface operators suffer from logarithmic divergences 
reflecting a conformal anomaly. In a holographic setting, where 
surface operators can be computed by a minimal surface in $AdS$, the 
leading contribution to the anomaly comes from a divergence in 
the classical action (or area) of the minimal surface. We study the 
subleading correction to it due to quantum fluctuations of the minimal 
surface. In the same way that the divergence in the area does not require 
a global solution but only a near-boundary analysis, the same holds 
for the quantum corrections. We study the asymptotic form of the 
fluctuation determinant and show how to use the heat kernel to 
calculate the quantum anomaly. In the case of M2-branes describing 
surface operators in the ${\cal N}=(2,0)$ theory in 6d, our calculation 
of the one-loop determinant reproduces 
expressions for the anomaly that have been found by less direct methods.
