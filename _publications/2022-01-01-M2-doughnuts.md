We present a family of new M2-brane solutions in $AdS_7\times S^4$ that calculate toroidal BPS 
surface operators in the $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory. These observables 
are conformally invariant and not subject to anomalies so we are 
able to evaluate their finite expectation values at leading order at large $N$.
In the limit of a thin torus we find a cylinder, which is a natural surface generalization 
of both the circular and parallel lines Wilson loop. We study and comment on this limit in some detail.
