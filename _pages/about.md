Hello there and welcome to my personal page!

I'm a theoretical physicist reorienting into machine learning.

My physics research has been motivated by understanding properties of
strongly-coupled systems by studying extended objects known as defects. In a
series of projects I have developped tools to construct and calculate properties
of defects in the context of holography, the conformal bootstrap and especially using
supersymmetry. In particular I have played a leading role in applying new
techniques to a mysterious 6d theory predicted by string theory, known as the 6d
$\mathcal{N} = (2,0)$ theory.

More recently I have been interested in exploring scalability and
interpretability of deep neural networks.
