I'm a theoretical physicist reorienting into machine learning.

### Physics
My research in physics is motivated by understanding the properties of
strongly-coupled systems by studying extended objects known as defects. This is
a research direction that ultimately attempts to understand the mechanisms behind
confinement in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) (the defect in this case is
called a Wilson line), by studying toy models sharing some similarities with
QCD.

In a series of projects I have developped tools to construct and calculate
properties of defects in the context of holography, the conformal bootstrap and
especially using supersymmetry. In particular I have played a leading role in
applying new techniques to a mysterious strongly-coupled 6d theory predicted by
string theory, known as the 6d $\mathcal{N} = (2,0)$ theory.

### Machine learning
More recently I am interested in exploring scalability and interpretability of
deep neural networks. These are two directions trying to achieve more powerful
and trustworthy AI models.
