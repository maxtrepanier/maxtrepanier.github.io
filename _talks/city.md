*Abstract*:
The 6d (2, 0) theories are superconformal field theories believed to describe the low-energy dynamics of N coincident M5-branes. These theories don‚Äôt have a known lagrangian description and remain largely mysterious, so it is an interesting question how one might calculate observables there. In this talk I will present two complementary approaches to a case study, the calculation of the 2-point function of stress tensors in the presence of a 1/2 BPS surface defect defined over a plane. First, we use analytical bootstrap techniques at large N to obtain the first nontrivial correction to this correlator, from which we extract the defect CFT (dCFT) data characterising the 2d dCFT of the 1/2 BPS plane. Along the way we derive a supersymmetric inversion formula and obtain the relevant superconformal blocks. Notably our result features a holomorphic function whose appearance is related to the chiral algebra construction of Beem et al. Second, we use that chiral algebra description to obtain exact results for the BPS sector of the dCFT, valid at any N and for any choice of surface operator. The setup we present here is remarkably simple and the same techniques can be applied to many more nonlagrangian theories.
