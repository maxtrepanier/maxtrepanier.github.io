*Abstract*: The 6d N=(2,0) theories contain a surprisingly intricate spectrum of BPS surface operators which generalise the construction of BPS Wilson loops over an arbitrary curve in 4d SYM. In this talk I will present their construction and discuss some of the properties that make them ideal observables to learn about the 6d (2,0) theories. In particular, I will approach them from the point of view of holography, where they are realised as calibrated M2-branes in $AdS_7xS^4$. I will discuss in more detail two examples for which I define and calculate a finite quantity analogous to the quark-antiquark potential of gauge theories. Finally I will comment on how these results may help us study the theory beyond the large N limit.
