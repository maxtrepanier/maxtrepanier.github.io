*Abstract*: One of the surprising predictions of string theory is the existence of QFTs in 6d with superconformal symmetry known as the 6d N=(2,0) theories. These theories contain surface operators which are analogous in many ways to Wilson loops in gauge theories. In this talk I will discuss some of the properties of these operators that make them ideal observables to learn about the 6d N=(2,0) theories. After reviewing the simplest example (the sphere) both in field theory and in holography, I will discuss how supersymmetry helps to find the holographic description for more complicated surface operators. In particular, in my recent work we found the holographic description for a class of tori, and their expectation value captures a 6d analog of the quark-antiquark potential.
