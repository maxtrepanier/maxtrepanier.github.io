*Abstract*: Surface operators are characterised by their conformal anomaly coefficients, the analog of the conformal anomalous dimension of local operators. In holography and for surface operators dual to minimal branes, it is well-known that the leading part of these anomalies coefficients is captured by the behavior of the brane near the boundary of AdS; a beautiful result due to Graham-Witten. In this talk, I will present a method to calculate the subleading contribution to these coefficients in the same spirit, by combining a near-AdS3 expansion with heat kernel techniques.  Applying this method to M2-branes, we obtain the first "direct" calculation of the anomaly coefficients for (locally supersymmetric) surface operators of the 6d (2,0) theory. The results agree with the existing literature, providing a check of more indirect methods, and evidence that the M2-brane action can be treated semiclassically by incorporating quantum corrections.
